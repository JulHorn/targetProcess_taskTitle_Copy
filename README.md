# Target Process Task Title Copy Tool

A small and hacky Chrome/Vivaldi extension, which copies some basic information from a task/bug/whatever to make my git committing life a bit easier. Copies a formatted string to the clipboard. E.g. for a task: "[TASK] #12345 Do it"


Simply press "strg  + y" in these cases:
1. when an element was selected via strg
2. when the detail view of an element is opened

This extension currently only exists unpacked. In order to use it, the developer mode hs to be activated on the extension page and the extension itself must be loaded via "Load unpacked extension".
